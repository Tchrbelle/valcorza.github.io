    <p>
        Training ICT, was very helpful now a days in the 21st generation. 
        Not only did it provide useful lessons, it was also an eye opener to warn against hacker on the internet in everyday life.
        I learned so much in this training very informative especially creating Web Page. 
        It was quite difficult at first but when you know all the procedures and codes it will be easy for you to create on your own Web Page its fun and you can make your own wed page creative. 
        It helps me a lot sooner or later I can use it in my profession when God let me enter to DepEd.
        Most importantly, saying Thank you to all of my ICT instructor is not enough but still Thank You ma’am/sir. 
        And to our ALS coordinator Sir Anthony Edmond Dumaog for allowing me to be part of this ICT training. 
        I couldn’t made this far without your helps more power and GOD BLESS!
